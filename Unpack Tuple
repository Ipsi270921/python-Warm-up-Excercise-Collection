#Unpacking the Tuple
####### Tuple unpacking means assigning values from a tuple (or any iterable) directly to multiple variables in one line. ######

person = ("Bharat", 38, "India")
name, age, country = person
print(name)
print(age)
print(country)

# Result
Bharat
38
India


###### Explation #####

#On the right side: (“Bharat”, 38, “India”) → a tuple with 3 values

#On the left side: name, age, country → 3 variables

#Python automatically assigns:

#name = "Bharat"

#age = 38

#country = "India"

#That’s tuple unpacking — Python “unpacks” the values into separate variables.


###### Rules of Tuple Unpacking #####

#1. Equal count (Number of variables must match number of elements) (for example: (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3))
#2. Too few or too many (Raises ValueError) (for example: (a, b) = (1, 2, 3))
#3. Works with any iterable...
  #First, what is an Iterable?
    #An iterable is anything you can use in a for loop.
# for an example
#for i in [1, 2, 3]:
    #print(i)
#[1, 2, 3] is iterable because you can go through each element.

#In Python, tuple unpacking is not limited only to tuples.
#It works with any iterable object — that is, any object you can loop over, such as:
✅ Lists

✅ Strings

✅ Sets

✅ Dictionaries

✅ Generator objects

✅ Ranges

#Even though we call it tuple unpacking, the left-hand side doesn’t have to be a tuple, and the right-hand side doesn’t have to be a tuple either — it just needs to be iterable.

### Unpacking from a List ###

numbers=[1, 2, 3]
a, b, c =numbers
print(a, b, c)

## Result
1 2 3


### Unpacking from String ###
word= "cat"
a, b, c= word
print(a, b, c)

##Result
c a t

### Unpacking from a Range ###
a, b, c, d = range(4)
print(a, b, c, d)

##Result
0 1 2 3 #range starts with 0 so it displays 0 1 2 3 total 4 
#range(4) returns a sequence → iterable, so unpacking works.



##### Unpacking from a Dictionary (Keys by Default) #####
person = {"name": "krish", "age": 20, "occupation": "Data Engineer"}
a, b, c= person
print(a, b, c)

## Result
name age occupation



### if want values ###
person = {"name": "krish", "age": 20, "occupation": "Data Engineer"}
a, b, c= person.values()
print(a, b, c)

## Result
krish 20 Data Engineer



### want key-value pairs ###

person = {"name": "krish", "age": 20, "occupation": "Data Engineer"}

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, "=>", value)

## Result

name => krish
age => 20
occupation => Data Engineer

#### Unpacking from a Set ####

my_set={2, 3, 4}
a, b, c = my_set

print(a, b, c)

## Result
2 3 4

#Works — but order is not guaranteed, since sets are unordered.
